# Operating System
The projects in this repository were for my operating system course.

The operating system course (CS416/CS518) is offered to undergraduate and graduate level students at 
Rutgers University.

## Projects
The projects in this repo contains three projects and they explore three fundamental pieces that make
the operating system. [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) describes the three fundamental 
pieces as <b>Virtualization, Concurrency, and Persistence</b>
 

1. [Virtual Memory](https://github.com/Rohan2002/Operating-System/tree/main/virtual-memory): Virtualization
2. [PThread Library](https://github.com/Rohan2002/Operating-System/tree/main/threading): Concurrency
3. [File System](https://github.com/Rohan2002/Operating-System/tree/main/file-system): Persistence
